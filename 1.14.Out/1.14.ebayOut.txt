Science & Technology
Proven
Bactericidal Advantage
SURGICEL
Family of
Absorbable Hemostats is the
first
and
only
absorbable hemostat that is
proven
bactericidal against a broad range of
gram-positive and gram-negative organisms including various antibiotic
resistant bacteria (MRSA, VRE, PRSP and MRSE)
In vivo animal studies have
demonstrated that SURGICEL
Absorbable Hemostats, in
contrast to other hemostatic agents studied, do not enhance infection.
The experimental model: 140 guinea
pigs were utilized to simulate the development of intra-abdominal abscess
and/or peritonitis, which can occur in humans when a large blood clot becomes
contaminated.
Clinical significance of these animal
or in vitro data has yet to be determined.
Closing SURGICEL
Absorbable Hemostats in a contaminated wound without
drainage may lead to complications and should be avoided.

you have any questions, please contact us. You can send a message via eBay or

LOT OF 2 ANTIQUE MEDICAL GLASS TUBES / JOHNSONS ETHICON / CURITY CHROMIC
This auction is for a lot of 2 antique medical glass tubes. I think they are some sort of thread inside but I'm no doctor so please look at the pictures to see what is included.
PAYMENTS
We accept PAYPAL, plus other options like local pickup for FREE and coming soon - ProPay!!  We do ship ASAP upon payment as noted above within 1 business day 95% of the time!! We do file Non Paying Bidder Alert with Ebay for non-payments!!!
Furthermore, Ebay's new payment rules of requiring all Ebay bidders to use an online electronic form of payment like Paypal, Propay, etc... which has scared away many of my loyal and repeat customers who do have have this form of payment method available. DO NOT let this be anobstacle to your bidding on any of my items!! I welcome all bids, even from those bidders who do not have a Paypal account.
NO RESERVE AUCTION!!!!
Bid early and do not let this one get away!
I usually have many items listed on Ebay at the same time.
If you win more than one auction, I will combine your shipping and handling to save you money $$$ based on weight and distance.
BID IN CONFIDENCE  CHECK MY FEEDBACK!
My goal is your satisfaction. I leave positive feedback right after the payment is received for all payments!! If you plan to leave anything less than positive feedback and 5 stars - please let me know so that I can work out any problems that you may have.
INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS - PLEASE READ
Attention all international bidders - I welcome bids from all around this great world of ours!! But please note that I only ship outside of the United States via USPS (United States Postal Service) by Priority Mail ONLY unless its a smaller item in which case I can ship via USPS First Class mail if the value is under $50.00 in value. The only exception is with the country of Italy. All purchases from Italy will only be shipped via USPS Priority Mail. This is for both your protection, speedy delivery of your purchase and for delivery confirmation/tracking. Please feel free to contact me for a S&H quote but please do so upto 24 hours before the auction ends. I'm not always home in front of my computer when my many listings end. Please also be aware of your countries shipping policies with importing items from the United States as some have various taxes, custom dues, VAT taxes, etc....
Import duties, taxes and charges are
not included
in the item price or shipping charges. These charges are the buyers responsibility.
Please check with your countrys customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding/buying.
SHIPPING & HANDLING FOR US BIDDERS
Shipping and handling is set at a fixed rate for for the upper 48 states. My goal is to ALWAYS ship out the next business day!!! I normally ship using either USPS Priority Mail shipping or FEDEX Ground shipping so that you get your items right away!!! Please note that Ebay doesn't have a shipping option for Fedex so I'm forced to UPS Ground as the shipping option on their system but items will be shipped via Fedex instead. Hawaii, Alaska, Guamand Puerto Rico will be slightly higher.
Pennsylvania Residents must add 6% sales tax to your winning bid
No charge for local pickup on any of my items!!
MOST items are shipped the next business day.
Larger/Heavier items are shipped via Fedex within 2 business days.
PAYMENT AND RETURNS
We accept PAYPAL, plus other options like local pickup for FREE and coming soon - ProPay!!  We do ship ASAP upon payment as noted above.We do file Non Paying Bidder Alert with Ebay for non-payments!

Description: 
Low pelvic
access
Unique
curved head design provides a 40mm cut line in a 30 mm space allowing for lower
pelvic access
The
CONTOUR Curved Cutter Stapler has a 17mm smaller head width than Covidiens
Radial Reload (with Tri-Staple Technology) to enable deep pelvic access.*
Larger
jaw aperture facilitates maneuverability and mobility along the colon
Increased
control
Manual
pin placement captures intended tissue before closing device
The
intermediate locking position captures the tissue with the jaws partially open,
allowing for repositioning of the tissue within the instrument if desired. The
closure trigger can be released and the jaw will remain open to allow for final
positioning of the tissue before it is cut and stapled. Throughout this
process, the retaining pin is fully engaged.
Enhanced
usability
Breakthrough
washer provides audible and tactile feedback every firing and new stainless
steel anvil with every cartridge
With
reloadable cartridges, the device may be fired up to 6 times in a single
procedure
The
CONTOUR Curved Cutter Stapler can be used in colorectal, gastrointestinal and
skeletal muscle stapling procedures. It allows for lower pelvic access in LAR
procedures and provides a clean transection of muscle belly in procedures such
as above/below-knee amputations.

Description: 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!!!
The most important thing in the world to me is that every single buyer is
100% "5-Star Satisfied"
with every single purchase! If
ANYTHING
happens and there's a problem with your purchase I would ask you to
PLEASE, PLEASE CONTACT ME BEFORE CONTACTING eBAY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:
- Damaged In Transit
- Not Working
- Not Working As Described
- Wrong Item
eBay has changed their policies and has this new little jewel called "Defect Rates." Conceptually, it's a really good thing, but the way they deal with issues that are out of buyers control is absolutely crazy!
So, I would simply ask if you would give me an opportunity to
EXCEED YOUR EXPECTATIONS
before opening a case with eBay and if I don't exceed them then by all means, I'll dial the number for you myself :-) Thanks for looking and thanks for placing your trust in me and I'll NEVER, EVER abuse or neglect that trust.
Now....on with the listing....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BUYER PAYS $29.95 FOR DOMESTIC SHIPPING
INTERNATIONAL BUYERS need to contact me before bidding so we can discuss all of the costs associated with your shipment. Ill give you a ROCK SOLID QUOTE on shipping so youll know exactly what to expect. IF INTERNATIONAL BUYERS BID WITHOUT CONTACTING ME FIRST, THEIR BID WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CANCELED!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HERE WE GO.....
This auction is for a
ETHICON ULTRACISION G110 ENDO-SURGERY HARMONIC SCALPEL GENERATOR!!
NEW RULE REGARDING RETURNS!!
- If you contact eBay to initiate a return (FOR ANY REASON) I get hit with a DEFECT and gang, I work unbelievably hard to AVOID THOSE!!
- So, in order to qualify for a return, You MUST CONTACT ME TO INITIATE A RETURN! I PROMISE, as long as it's in the same condition as when it was shipped out of here, you can return it with no issues whatsoever.
So, as long as you contact me first......
FOR THIS AUCTION,
I'm standing behind it and you have
14days
to check it out. If you don't want it (REGARDLESS OF THE REASON) just ship it back to me and I'll give you a full refund (less shipping). If you want to return it once we passed the 14 day mark, you can still do that too but there will be a 20% restocking fee.

Description: 
80 COUNT VICRYL POP-OFF SUTURES IN 10X 8 PACKS
45cm BRAIDED AND COATED
ON A 40mm CT-1 TAPER NEEDLE
THESE ARE OUTDATED SO WOULD BE IDEAL FOR PRACTICE,
HOWEVER THEY ARE STILL STERILE IN UNOPENED PACKAGES.
THE REASON SUTURES ARE DATED IS SO THAT THE MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANIES CAN SELL MORE SUTURES.
I PERSONALLY WOULD NOTHESITATETO USE THESE FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED, I TAKE NO STOCK IN THE EXPIRATION DATES AS LONG AS THEY ARE STILL UNOPENED AND STERILE
WOULD STILL BE GOOD FOR A BUG OUT BAG, A SHTF STOCKPILE,VETERINARY USE, PRACTICE, REPAIRING GEAR, ETC
WILL SHIPP FREE!!!!!

Description: 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!!!
The most important thing in the world to me is that every single
buyer is
100% "5-Star Satisfied"
with every single
purchase! If
ANYTHING
happens and there's a problem with your
purchase I would ask you to
PLEASE,
PLEASE CONTACT ME BEFORE CONTACTING eBAY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:
Damaged In
     Transit
Not Working
Not Working As
     Described
Wrong Item
eBay has changed their policies and has this new little jewel
called "Defect Rates." Conceptually, it's a really good thing,
but the way they deal with issues that are out of buyers control and is
absolutely crazy!
So, I would simply ask if you would give me an opportunity to
EXCEED YOUR EXPECTATIONS
before opening a case with eBay and if I
don't exceed them then by all means, I'll dial the number for you myself
:-) Thanks for looking and thanks for placing your trust in me and I'll
NEVER, EVER abuse or neglect that trust.
Now....on with the listing....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTICE!! PLEASE READ THE SHIPPING INFORMATION VERY
CAREFULLY!!
ONLY IF THE
"BUY IT NOW"
OPTION IS USED WILL THE BUYER RECEIVE
FREE EXPEDITED SHIPPING & HANDLING!
In the event the MAKE OFFER option is used, or the auction
"Goes The Distance" and the
BUY IT NOW IS NOT USED or NOT SHOWING, S&H will be
$12.95.
If you do not use the BUY IT NOW option, please
do not pay until I have sent an invoice.
If the BUY IT NOW option isn't available, that means that someone
has placed a bid and opted to not use that option. In that case, shipping
will be
$12.95
.
INTERNATIONAL BUYERS need to contact me before bidding so we can
discuss all of the costs associated with your shipment. Ill give you a
ROCK SOLID QUOTE on shipping so youll know exactly what to expect.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This auction is for a box of
NEW
ECR60B
(08/2019)
ECHELON ENDOPATH STAPLER RELOADS
.
I
 purchasedthis product from a regional auction and as you can see by the date and by the box, this is absolutely, positively BRAND NEW, NEVER OPENED and 100% GUARANTEED!!
Due to the nature of this product, I'll only give a refund if the product is returned to me in ORIGINAL, UNOPENED CONDITION.
If you 
don't want it (REGARDLESS OF THE REASON) just ship it back to me and 
I'll give you a full refund (less shipping). If you want to return it 
once we passed the 14 day mark, you can still do that too but there will
 be a 20% restocking fee (again, provided that the box is unopened and the product is untouched).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description: 
Proximate ILS Curved Intraluminal Stapler Ethicon Endo-surgery. CDH21. Expired 2008-07
Tissue thickness varies  even within a single patient's GI tract. 
That's why our circular staplers enable you to adjust staple height to 
accommodate tissue that's between 1.0mm and 2.5mm thick. Our new 
intraluminal stapler has a Tissue Compression Indicator, which measures 
compressed tissue thickness at specific positions within a gap setting 
scale.
When applied to tissue, these staplers provide the necessary 
compression to create the anastomosis. During firing, the controlled 
tissue compression and adjustable-height staples allow for uniform 
staple formation at the specific staple height. Afterwards, the formed 
staples continue to deliver the proper compression to provide a 
leak-free anastomosis and good hemostasis to facilitate healing.
